# Clipboard-Speaker
Speaks what's on your clipboard. Copy a text, wait for the machine to understand it, and listen closely! It's that easy. However, don't terminate the program. Minimize it, let it run over your taskbar.

Not sure whether it's useful for visually impaireds, but would love to modify to suffice their needs anytime.

### Notes
This project was created and tested under Windows, and it doesn't work fully in other systems

This project is still under development. Parts of the source codes may not be well documented.
Also suitable prompts may not be available for the user at the moment.

More features and fixes are yet to come. Meanwhile suggestions, ideas, bug reports are welcomed.

I am a python n00bie! I am still learning python! I have tried my best to give in as much effort required (of course directly proportionate to my knowledge), for this project.
